 Insertion Sort implementation: "is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. 
 The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. 
 Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part." - Geek for geeks

 Complexity: O(nÂ²) in the best and worst case.
